## Design
### Overall Feel

For this site I wanted a very white, modern feel that would emulate a gallery experience. Generally speaking, galleries have stark white walls that offer no distraction from the work exhibited and that is the experience that I wanted to capture. 

### Colour Scheme

While white is the main colour for the site and will be itilized as much as possible, I chose accent colours that I thought would not be overwhelming and add an elegance to it. 

![colour scheme](docs/colour-scheme.PNG)

The colours are muted and quite neutral so as to not overwhelm the user. 
The gold adds a touch of decadance.
The dark grey will be used for the majority of the text.

### Typography
I chose the [Abel](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Abel) font for the text throughout the site. I like the simplicity of a san serif font but Able has a little bit of personality. 


### Imagery

The imagery throughout the site will be primarily dictated by the products for sale.

However, to add to the modern feel, the background image consists of line art hexagons in a muted colour. This will break the white up slightly without distracting from the work on sale. 

The home page uses shapes in the accent colours and a few selected works to give the illusion of images hanging in a group on a wall - something that a customer could do if they had a few pieces to display.
